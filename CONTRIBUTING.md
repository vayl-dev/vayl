# Contributing to Vayl

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Bug reports, docs, tests, new LLM providers, and
reconciliation edge cases are especially welcome.

The full contributor guide lives in the docs:

- 👉 **[Local development](https://vayl.gitbook.io/vayl-docs/documentation/development/local-development)**: setup, running the unit and integration suites,
  lint and type checks, and the repository layout.
- 👉 **[Contributing](https://vayl.gitbook.io/vayl-docs/documentation/development/contributing)**: the pull request workflow, required checks, and conventions.

## TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vayl-dev/vayl && cd vayl
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,server,postgres]"
pytest            # offline unit tests (deterministic, no LLM/network)
ruff check .      # lint
```

## Good first contributions

New here? These are self-contained and have a clear template to copy — look for the
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/vayl-dev/vayl/labels/good%20first%20issue) label, or start with one of these:

- **Add a slot-schema preset for a domain you know** (legal, devops, real-estate, gaming, recruiting…).
  A preset is one JSON file that gives an agent a declared vocabulary so its memory reconciles reliably.
  Copy an existing one (`src/vayl/presets/coding.json` or `support.json`), add per-preset assertions to
  `tests/test_presets.py`, and it auto-bundles into the wheel. Enable with `VAYL_SLOT_SCHEMA=preset:<name>`.
  This is the single easiest way to contribute.
- **Add a framework adapter.** Wrap the client for another agent framework (LlamaIndex, Pydantic AI,
  AutoGen, …). Python adapters live in `src/vayl/integrations/` and subclass `BaseVaylMemory` — use
  `langgraph.py` as the template; TypeScript adapters are subpath modules under
  `clients/typescript/src/integrations/`. Each exposes the same curated tool surface via `_common`.
- **Docs & setup guides** — a dedicated MCP-client walkthrough (Cursor, Windsurf, Zed), a tutorial, or
  a worked example. Docs live in GitBook, but a Markdown draft in a PR is a great start.

## Ground rules

- Keep the **core dependencies few** (today `fastmcp`, `mcp`, `cryptography`); anything heavier goes
  behind an optional extra in `pyproject.toml`.
- Unit tests stay **offline and deterministic** — LLM-dependent checks belong in `benchmarks/`.
  This is enforced: `tests/conftest.py` fails any test that tries to reach a model or cloud port
  (Ollama, HTTP/S), even if the code swallows the error. Stub the seam instead — e.g.
  `monkeypatch.setattr("vayl.memory.llm_client._embed", …)` or `llm_memory.llm_extract_classify`.
- New behaviour needs a test, and `ruff check .` must pass.
- The audit hash-chain is a security guarantee: changes under `src/vayl/security/audit.py` need a
  concurrency test (see `tests/test_accountability.py`).
- For anything substantial, **open an issue first** so we can align on approach before a big PR.
