Vayl — reconciliation data model
================================
The shared domain model the reconciler runs on: the event log's `Statement`, the
`Status` a statement can hold, and the `Action` the engine takes on a new fact.
The live reconciler is LLM-driven and lives in `llm_memory.py`; this module holds
only what that path (and the store, clinical medrec, and demo) import.

The thesis it serves: the product's job is not perfect auto-resolution
(impossible) — it's to NEVER be *silently wrong*. Clear cases auto-resolve;
ambiguous cases get FLAGGED, not guessed.
