"""
Decision audit for Vayl (Feature 1) — the queryable record of WHY an agent acted.

When an agent takes an action, it records a decision: the action summary plus a SNAPSHOT of the exact
beliefs it consulted — each fact's value, who asserted it, its confidence, and what it superseded.

Because facts change, the snapshot is IMMUTABLE: it records what was believed at decision time, so
"why did the agent do X?" is answerable even after those facts are later superseded, retracted, or
erased. Each decision is content-hashed and Ed25519-signed (when a signer is attached), so the record
itself is tamper-evident — a decision receipt, not just a log line.

Stored in the same SQLite DB; summary + snapshot are encrypted at rest when encryption is on.
