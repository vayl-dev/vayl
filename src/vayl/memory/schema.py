"""
Slot schema — a declared vocabulary for the facts a deployment cares about.

Vayl normally lets the extractor name its own slots, which suits open-ended memory: nobody can
enumerate in advance every fact an agent might learn about a customer. It has one consequence,
measured on real conversational data: 626 distinct subjects across 638 facts, ~2% reuse. The
same-slot invariant resolves rivals by exact subject equality, so when the extractor names a
slot descriptively per utterance — `melanie_self_care_practices` on Monday and
`melanie_reports_self_care_enables_family_care` on Tuesday — the invariant never fires and two
statements about one thing sit side by side, unreconciled.

For open-ended memory that is a quality problem. For a domain with known critical fields it is a
correctness problem: `check("allergy")` cannot answer if the allergy was filed under
`patient_penicillin_allergy_reported_by_nurse`, and the critical-fact channel cannot inject a
category nobody tagged.

A schema fixes the vocabulary for the slots that matter and leaves everything else free-form.
It is deterministic — canonical names and declared aliases, no similarity threshold — because
guessing that two slots are "the same" is how a reconciling store silently destroys a fact it
should have kept. Embedding-based resolution for the open-ended case is a separate problem and
deliberately not solved here.

Declaring a slot also carries two properties the rest of the system reads:

    category  — tags every fact in the slot, feeding the critical-fact channel so allergies
                reach the answer regardless of ranking
    verbatim  — the value must be stored exactly as stated. Normalization is lossy by design
                ("500mg twice daily" -> "twice_daily" loses the dose), which is fine for
                `favourite_colour` and unacceptable for a prescription.
    confirm   — replacing or removing a value in this slot is PROPOSED, not applied. The current
                value stands until a human approves. Reconciliation is driven by an LLM reading
                conversational text, and "stop the warfarin" appearing in a sentence is not the
                same as an order to stop it. For most slots being wrong is recoverable; for some
                the write itself is the hazard, and those need a person in the loop.
    multi     — the slot holds a LIST, not a single value: a patient has many allergies and many
                active medications at once. A new distinct value COEXISTS with the others instead
                of superseding them. Without this, recording a second allergy silently deletes the
                first — the same-slot invariant (one current value) is correct for single-valued
                state and catastrophic for a list. A specific value is still individually removed
                by a retract that names it.

      {"name": "allergy",           "category": "critical", "verbatim": true,
       "description": "a substance the patient reacts to",

      {"name": "active_medication", "category": "critical", "verbatim": true,
       "description": "a medication the patient is currently taking"},
      {"name": "code_status",       "category": "critical",
       "description": "resuscitation preference (full code, DNR, DNI)"}
