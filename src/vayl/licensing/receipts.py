"""
Verifiable memory (Feature 3) — cryptographic proof of what was erased and what was known.

Two signed artifacts, both Ed25519-signed over a canonical JSON so a THIRD PARTY can verify with only
the public key — no access to the database or the secret:

  • erasure receipt      — proves a delete happened: {action, scope, subject, count, chain_hash, ts}.
                           The GDPR "prove you erased my data" artifact.
  • knowledge attestation — proves a fact was held at a time: {subject, value, chain_hash, ts}.
                           The "prove what was known, and when" artifact.

Each artifact carries `chain_hash` — the tamper-evident audit-log head at the moment it was issued —
so it's anchored to the history that recorded the event, not floating free.

`verify()` RECOMPUTES the canonical body from the payload before checking the signature, so editing
any field (a count, a subject) invalidates the proof. Never trust a stored `body`; always recompute.

Persisted receipts are encrypted at rest (they can reference erased subjects) but returned in the
clear so they stay third-party-verifiable — the signature commits to the plaintext either way.
