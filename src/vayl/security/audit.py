"""
Append-only, tamper-evident audit log for Vayl — accountability (GDPR Art. 5(2)) and breach
investigation, upgraded into a cryptographic record of what the system did.

Records every data operation (who / what / when): the space (user/agent/run), the action, and a
short detail. Stored in the same SQLite DB in its own table; it is NOT wiped by memory erasure
(`delete_all` clears facts, not the accountability trail) — retain/rotate it per your own policy.

TAMPER-EVIDENCE (F0.2 — the substrate for verifiable memory):
Each row is hash-chained to its predecessor — `entry_hash = sha256(prev_hash | canonical(row))` —
so editing, deleting, or reordering any row breaks the chain and `verify_chain()` pinpoints where.
When a signer is attached, each entry_hash is also Ed25519-signed, so a third party can verify the
log's integrity WITHOUT the secret key. This is what lets Vayl prove "this is what was known, and
when" rather than merely assert it.
