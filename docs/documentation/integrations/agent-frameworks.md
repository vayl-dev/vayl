# Agent frameworks

Add Vayl to an agent you already build with a framework, and its memory stops going stale. Each adapter gives your agent five memory tools, `remember`, `recall`, `history`, `forget` and `list_memories`, and the agent decides when to call them.

Because Vayl reconciles, the agent is never handed a fact and its replacement as if both were current:

```
"We use Redux."                           → stored
"Actually we moved off Redux to Zustand." → Redux retired, Zustand active
recall("what do we use?")                 → an answer built from Zustand only
```

A plain vector store would return both. Vayl keeps the old value in `history` instead. `recall` answers are written by the model, so the exact wording varies.

## How the adapters work

Every adapter has the same shape: bind a memory to a [memory space](../core-concepts/memory-spaces.md) once, then hand its tools to your agent.

* **Same tools everywhere.** The five tools have the same names and model-facing descriptions in every framework.
* **Scope is bound in your code.** `user_id` / `agent_id` / `run_id` are set on the client, never as tool arguments, so the model can't read or change whose memory it touches.
* **One connection.** The adapter keeps one session open, either to a local `vayl-mcp` it starts over stdio, or to a shared `vayl-server` over HTTP.

| Framework | Language | Install | Import |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LangGraph / LangChain | Python | `pip install 'vayl-mcp[langgraph]'` | `from vayl.integrations.langgraph import VaylMemory` |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | Python | `pip install 'vayl-mcp[openai-agents]'` | `from vayl.integrations.openai_agents import VaylMemory` |
| CrewAI | Python | `pip install 'vayl-mcp[crewai]'` | `from vayl.integrations.crewai import VaylMemory` |
| Vercel AI SDK | TypeScript | `npm i @vayl.dev/client ai zod @ai-sdk/openai` | `import { vaylTools } from "@vayl.dev/client/vercel"` |
| Mastra | TypeScript | `npm i @vayl.dev/client @mastra/core zod` | `import { vaylTools } from "@vayl.dev/client/mastra"` |

The TypeScript client starts `vayl-mcp` for local use, so install the Python package too (`pip install vayl-mcp`), or connect to a team server with `url` and `apiKey`.

## Two sets of model settings

Your agent and Vayl each call a model, and each is configured separately:

* **Your framework's model** (the one that runs the agent) reads its own settings, for example `OPENAI_API_KEY` for `gpt-4o`.
* **Vayl's model** (the one that extracts and reconciles facts) reads the environment of the `vayl-mcp` process. By default that process inherits your process environment, so one `OPENAI_API_KEY` covers both. To give Vayl different settings, pass `env={...}` (Python) or `env: {...}` (TypeScript), which replaces the inherited environment (only basics such as `PATH` and `HOME` are kept). See [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md).

When you connect to a team server with `url=` and `api_key=`, Vayl uses the server's model settings, and only your framework needs a key.

## Python

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="LangGraph" %}
```bash
pip install 'vayl-mcp[langgraph]' langchain-openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

`langchain-openai` is not part of the `[langgraph]` extra. You need it for the `"openai:..."` model string below; without it, `mem.agent(...)` fails with an `ImportError` asking you to install it. Use the LangChain package for your provider instead if you don't use OpenAI.

```python
from vayl.integrations.langgraph import VaylMemory

with VaylMemory(user_id="proj_7") as mem:
    agent = mem.agent("openai:gpt-4o-mini")      # a ready agent with the memory tools and a memory-aware prompt
    result = agent.invoke({"messages": [("user", "We moved off Redux to Zustand. What do we use now?")]})
    print(result["messages"][-1].content)
```

To use your own agent or graph, bind the tools directly:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent

agent = create_agent("openai:gpt-4o-mini", tools=mem.tools())
```

`mem.agent()` uses LangChain v1's `create_agent`, and falls back to `langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent` on older installs.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="OpenAI Agents SDK" %}
```bash
pip install 'vayl-mcp[openai-agents]'
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

```python
from agents import Runner
from vayl.integrations.openai_agents import VaylMemory

with VaylMemory(user_id="proj_7") as mem:
    agent = mem.agent(model="gpt-4o")      # or: Agent(name=..., tools=mem.tools())
    result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "We moved off Redux to Zustand. What do we use now?")
    print(result.final_output)
```

The memory tools are SDK function tools. An SDK `Session` and Vayl work together: the `Session` for within-conversation continuity, Vayl for facts that last across sessions.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CrewAI" %}
```bash
pip install 'vayl-mcp[crewai]'
```

```python
from crewai import Agent
from vayl.integrations.crewai import VaylMemory

with VaylMemory(user_id="proj_7") as mem:
    analyst = Agent(role="Analyst", goal="Answer with current facts",
                    backstory="Uses long-term memory.", tools=mem.tools())
    # build your tasks and Crew as usual, inside the with-block
```

`mem.agent(role=..., llm=...)` returns a ready `crewai.Agent` with a memory-aware backstory. The adapter targets the CrewAI v1 tools API (`crewai.tools.tool`).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Needs verification.** CrewAI is not installed in Vayl's CI, so the CrewAI adapter is checked for safe import and the missing-package error only. Its runtime behaviour has not been verified for this page.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In every Python adapter:

* `mem.tools(include=[...])` or `mem.tools(exclude=[...])` narrows the tool set.
* `mem.remember(...)`, `mem.recall(...)`, `mem.history(...)`, `mem.forget(...)` and `mem.list_memories()` call memory directly from your own code.
* `VaylMemory(url="https://your-host/mcp", api_key="vayl_sk_...", user_id=...)` connects to a team server instead of starting `vayl-mcp`.
* `VaylMemory(client=existing_vayl_client)` reuses a connection you already opened; the adapter then leaves closing it to you.

## TypeScript

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Vercel AI SDK" %}
```bash
npm i @vayl.dev/client ai zod @ai-sdk/openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

`@ai-sdk/openai` provides the `openai(...)` model below. It is not a dependency of `@vayl.dev/client`.

```typescript
import { generateText, stepCountIs } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Vayl } from "@vayl.dev/client";
import { vaylTools } from "@vayl.dev/client/vercel";

const m = await Vayl.connect({ userId: "proj_7" });
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: vaylTools(m),
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
  prompt: "We moved off Redux to Zustand. What do we use now?",
});
console.log(text);
await m.close();
```

The adapter targets AI SDK v7 (`ai@>=7`).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mastra" %}
```bash
npm i @vayl.dev/client @mastra/core zod
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Vayl } from "@vayl.dev/client";
import { vaylTools } from "@vayl.dev/client/mastra";

const m = await Vayl.connect({ userId: "proj_7" });
const agent = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  name: "Assistant",
  instructions: "Call recall before answering; call remember when the user states or changes a fact.",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  tools: vaylTools(m),
});
```

`"openai/gpt-4o"` is a Mastra v1 model-router string, so no `@ai-sdk/*` import is needed. The adapter targets `@mastra/core@>=1`.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

`vaylTools(m, { include: [...], exclude: [...] })` narrows the tool set. For a team server, connect with `Vayl.connect({ url: "https://your-host/mcp", apiKey: "vayl_sk_...", userId: "proj_7" })`.

## Framework memory and Vayl together

Each of these frameworks has its own memory or store, and those accumulate what you write. Vayl reconciles, and keeps an auditable history. Use the framework's store for raw conversation history, and Vayl for the durable facts the agent must keep current.
