# Safety gates & human approval

Reconciliation keeps memory current. For agents where a wrong action is costly (clinical, financial, legal), Vayl adds five guardrails on top: an action gate, a human approval queue, trusted sources for authorized feeds, a critical-fact channel, and declared slots that tie them together.

The examples use a clinical space, `user_id="patient_42"`, with the built-in `preset:clinical` schema. Outputs are real tool output; subject names under your own schema will be the ones you declare.

## Gate an action on the facts behind it

Before your agent acts on a fact, ask whether it's safe to:

```python
check_before_act(subject="active_medication", user_id="patient_42")
```

```
✅ SAFE to act on 'active_medication'.
  current: active_medication = metformin 500 mg PO twice daily; active_medication = warfarin 7 mg PO daily
```

When a check fails, the result is `BLOCKED` with one line per reason:

```
⛔ BLOCKED — do NOT act on 'active_medication':
  • recently changed 0.0d ago — may be unsettled
```

The policy is set per call:

| Parameter | Default | Blocks when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `block_on_flagged` | `True` | the value is disputed (`FLAGGED_CONFLICT`) |
| `min_confidence` | `0.7` | the fact's confidence is below this |
| `require_active` | `True` | the fact is no longer current (superseded or historical) |
| `max_staleness_days` | `0` (off) | the fact was last set more than this many days ago |
| `block_on_recent_change_days` | `0` (off) | the fact replaced an earlier value less than this many days ago |

Staleness and recent-change blocking are off unless you pass a value above 0. For a high-stakes action, set them explicitly, for example `max_staleness_days=90, block_on_recent_change_days=1`.

`safe_recall` combines recall with the same gate. It answers only if every current fact behind the answer passes the policy; otherwise it withholds the answer and says why:

```python
safe_recall(question="what is the current medication plan?", user_id="patient_42",
            block_on_recent_change_days=1)
```

```
⛔ WITHHELD — not safe to act on this answer:
  • recently changed 0.0d ago — may be unsettled
```

When it does answer, the answer is written by the model, like any recall. Use `safe_recall` instead of `recall` on the path to an irreversible action.

## Require a person to approve risky changes

Some writes are themselves the hazard: "we should probably stop the warfarin" in a note is not an order to stop it. A slot declared with `confirm: true` doesn't apply a replacement or removal. It records a **proposal**, leaves the current value standing, and waits for a person:

```python
remember(text="Increase warfarin to 7 mg PO daily", user_id="patient_42")
# Stored: [FLAG] active_medication = warfarin 7 mg PO daily

pending_changes(user_id="patient_42")
```

```
1 change(s) awaiting approval:
  #4 REPLACE active_medication: 'warfarin 5 mg PO daily' -> 'warfarin 7 mg PO daily'
        said: 'Increase warfarin to 7 mg PO daily'

Approve with confirm_change(memory_id), discard with reject_change(memory_id).
```

Approve or discard it:

```python
confirm_change(memory_id=4, user_id="patient_42", decided_by="phoned pharmacy")
# Approved #4: SUPERSEDE active_medication = warfarin 7 mg PO daily

reject_change(memory_id=4, user_id="patient_42")
# Discarded #4. The current value is unchanged.
```

### Who can approve

`confirm_change` and `reject_change` need the **`approve`** capability, which only the `admin` and `member` roles have (0.6.0). An agent key can propose a change but can't approve its own proposal, or quietly discard the queue:

```
Access denied: 'confirm_change' requires the 'approve' capability; your role(s) ['agent'] do not grant it.
```

The approver recorded in the audit log is the authenticated caller, as `name [principal_id]`. `decided_by` is only an optional note stored beside it, so nobody can record a decision in someone else's name. Over local stdio the caller is the local admin (`local [local]`); give each approver their own `member` key on `vayl-server`.

### How proposals behave

* A proposal is **flagged, not active**, so recall never presents it as current.
* A first write to a gated slot isn't gated. There is nothing to lose yet.
* Proposing the same change twice queues it once.
* A proposal can't be confirmed once the value it would have replaced has changed. It was made against state that no longer holds; `confirm_change` says so and the change must be proposed again.
* A rejected proposal is kept as history: that someone proposed it is worth auditing.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`forget` on a confirm-gated slot queues a removal proposal but currently replies `Nothing matching to retract (that fact isn't currently stored).` Check `pending_changes()` after a gated `forget`.
{% endhint %}

## Let authorized feeds skip the queue

A structured feed, such as a FHIR `MedicationRequest` with `status=stopped`, is already an authorized order: the sign-off happened upstream. Re-queuing it for approval is friction, not safety. List those feeds as trusted sources:

```bash
VAYL_TRUSTED_SOURCES=fhir,hl7
```

A `remember(..., source="fhir")` then applies directly, even on a `confirm` slot. Because `source` is a string the caller chooses, claiming a trusted source is itself an approval. Since 0.6.0 it's allowed only for a key whose principal name equals the source, or a caller with `approve`:

```python
create_principal("fhir", role="agent", scopes="patient_42")   # the feed's own key (admin only)
```

Any other key gets, and the audit log records:

```
Access denied: 'fhir' is a trusted source (VAYL_TRUSTED_SOURCES), so its changes skip the confirmation gate. Only a key named 'fhir', or one with the 'approve' capability, may write as it.
```

## Make critical facts impossible to miss

Ordinary recall passes the model every fact when a space is small (up to `VAYL_RECALL_CONTEXT`, 40 by default) and the top-ranked ones when it's larger. For most memory a low-ranked fact is a quality issue. For an allergy it's a safety issue: it isn't ranked low, it's **absent**, and the gates above can't judge a fact they were never given.

Mark categories critical so their facts skip ranking and always reach `recall` and `safe_recall`:

```bash
VAYL_CRITICAL_CATEGORIES=critical
```

A fact gets a category from its declared slot (below), or from the caller's metadata:

```python
remember(text="Patient is allergic to penicillin", user_id="patient_42",
         metadata={"category": "critical"})
recall(question="summarise the chart", user_id="patient_42",
       critical_categories="critical,allergy")   # per-call list
```

An empty `critical_categories` means "use `VAYL_CRITICAL_CATEGORIES`", never "none", so a caller can't opt out of what the operator marked critical.

If the critical set exceeds `VAYL_CRITICAL_BUDGET` (default 200), the read fails with `CriticalOverflow` instead of dropping part of it. Dropping part of an always-include set would recreate the miss it exists to prevent. The client sees `Vayl couldn't complete that (ref …)`; see [Troubleshooting](../reference/troubleshooting.md).

## Declare your domain's slots

By default the extractor names its own slots, which suits open-ended memory. For a domain with known fields, declare them so facts land in fixed slots and reconcile deterministically. Point `VAYL_SLOT_SCHEMA` at a JSON file, or at a built-in preset: `preset:assistant`, `preset:clinical`, `preset:coding`, `preset:finance`, `preset:sales`, `preset:support`.

```json
{"slots": [
  {"name": "allergy", "category": "critical", "verbatim": true, "multi": true, "confirm": false,
   "description": "a substance the patient reacts to, and the reaction",
   "aliases": ["allergies", "patient_allergy", "drug_allergy", "known_allergies"]},
  {"name": "active_medication", "category": "critical", "verbatim": true, "multi": true, "confirm": true,
   "description": "a medication the patient is currently taking, with dose and frequency",
   "aliases": ["current_medication", "medication", "prescribed_medication", "meds"]}
]}
```

That is an excerpt of `preset:clinical`, which also declares `code_status` (critical, confirm-gated), `primary_diagnosis` and `care_team_lead`.

| Property | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | required | The canonical subject. Slots without a name are ignored. |
| `description` | `""` | Tells the extractor what belongs in the slot. |
| `aliases` | `[]` | Other spellings that fold onto `name`. Matching ignores case and separators only (`Patient Allergy` = `patient_allergy`); it is never semantic. |
| `category` | `""` | Tags every fact in the slot. Feeds the critical-fact channel. |
| `verbatim` | `false` | Store the value exactly as stated. Normalizing is lossy: fine for a colour, unacceptable for a dose. |
| `multi` | `false` | The slot holds a list. A new distinct value is added alongside the others instead of replacing them, and a change or removal applies to the matching item (the drug, not the whole list). |
| `confirm` | `false` | Route replacements and removals through the approval queue above. |

A missing file, malformed JSON or unknown preset stops Vayl at startup rather than falling back to no schema. With no schema set, behaviour is unchanged.
